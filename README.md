## Introduction

This is a template for Terragrunt Stacks.

It is part of our [XOAP](https://xoap.io) Automation Forces Open Source community library to give you a quick start into Infrastructure as Code deployments with Terraform.

We have a lot of Terraform modules that are Open Source and maintained by the [XOAP](https://xoap.io) staff.

Please check the links for more info, including usage information and full documentation:

## Guidelines

We are using the following guidelines to write code and make it easier for everyone to follow a distinctive guideline.
Please check these links before starting to work on changes.

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Git Naming Conventions are an important part of the development process.
They describe how Branches, Commit Messages,
Pull Requests and Tags should look like to make them easily understandable for everybody in the development chain.

[Git Naming Conventions](https://namingconvention.org/git/)

He Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

The better a Pull Request description is, the better a review can understand and decide on how to review the changes.
This improves implementation speed and reduces communication between the requester,
and the reviewer is resulting in much less overhead.

[Writing A Great Pull Request Description](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/)

Versioning is a crucial part for Terraform Stacks and Modules.
Without version tags you cannot clearly create a stable environment
and be sure that your latest changes will not crash your production environment (sure it still can happen,
but we are trying our best to implement everything that we can to reduce the risk)

### About Terragrunt

[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) is a thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules, remote state, and locking.

Terragrunt is designed to fill in some gaps in Terraform:

- **Keep your Terraform code DRY**
- **Keep your remote state configuration DRY**
- **Keep your CLI flags DRY**
- **Work with multiple AWS accounts**
- **and much more**

We are using [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) to manage our Terraform Stacks and Modules.
